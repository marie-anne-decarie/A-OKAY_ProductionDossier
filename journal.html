        <h2>Sept. 23 - Initial film Proposal✧˖°.</h2>
        <p>// Working title: A-OKAY</p>
        <p>// Synopsis: In a dark digital void, a young protagonist must face off with a malevolent entity taking the form of an eerie, corrupted clone of herself. The clash is restless, brutal, and highly destructive, and although our young hero is definitely up to the task, one is left to wonder if anyone can really come out unscathed of such a fight against oneself…</p>
        <p>// Treatment: For this film’s technique, I am choosing 2D digital animation and digital compositing (After Effects) in order to best embody the cyberpunk genre and aesthetic I have in mind. The film will be incredibly fast paced, with bold perspective and high energy action. The movement of the animation will feel fast and brutal, translating the level of intensity of the fight happening on screen.</p>
        <p>The visuals will consist of dark, minimalist backgrounds starkly contrasted with brightly colored, almost glowing characters. Imagery throughout the film will evoke computers and digital technology, code, glitches, and the cyberspace. Each of the opponents will have a slightly different visual treatment as a way to differentiate them more easily on screen. Mars, the main protagonist, will be fully colored and her movement will be a lot more fluid and expressive than her digital counterpart. The latter will appear as a simple glowing outline on the screen, and her movement will be a lot jerkier – perhaps her framerate will be lower. She will also have some unique animations when she gets hit by Mars, such as glitches and morphing in and out of her clone form. In general, the color palette will be rather limited, primarily green, blue and orange. I also don’t want the film to feel repetitive or static at any point, so I will experiment with bold transitions and effects such as flashes or shots in which the characters are simply a solid-colored silhouette against the background.</p>

        <h2>20/10/24 - Update</h2>
        <p>. ݁₊ ⊹ . ݁ ⟡ ݁ . ⊹ ₊ ݁.. ݁₊ ⊹ . ݁ ⟡ ݁ . ⊹ ₊ ݁.. ݁₊ ⊹ . ݁ ⟡ ݁ . ⊹ ₊ ݁.</p>
        <p>Whoa there it's been a while! I have been so busy that I forgot to share any of what I was doing for the past few weeks. Let's catch up now!:)))</p>
        <p>// What progress have I made on the film so far?</p>
        <h3>// Research</h3>
        <p>I have been watching and studying various material in order to learn how to properly create a fight scene. I started gathering reference videos into a YouTube playlist, including tips for writing/staging action scenes, actual fight scenes from live action and animated media, real self-defense video tutorials, etc. I sat down for a few hours and storyboarded some of the interesting fight moves, as well as took notes on what really makes a good movie fight. </p>
        <p>The thing that stood out to me is the importance of establishing stakes: what do the characters have to lose if they don't win the fight? What are they fighting for? This leads me to...</p>
        <h3>// Writing</h3>
        <p>I sat down and started really thinking about the lore of my film. Who is Mars within her universe? Who is the clone? What makes the clone threatening, what is she trying to take from Mars? I wrote 3-4 pages of backstory which I won't be showing in the film just to really put myself in the world and mindset of these characters. The clone is trying to steal Mars' life away from her, to replace her. Mars has to fight to remain real, to remain alive; to avoid being replaced by a corporate, digital copy of herself. Themes of the film began to emerge as I was writing: the interconnected fear of technology and oneself; reality and the virtual; overcoming fear; AI and humans' terminal main character syndrom.</p>
        <p>. ݁₊ ⊹ . ݁ ⟡ ݁ . ⊹ ₊ ݁.. ݁₊ ⊹ . ݁ ⟡ ݁ . ⊹ ₊ ݁.. ݁₊ ⊹ . ݁ ⟡ ݁ . ⊹ ₊ ݁.</p>
        <h3>// Storyboarding and animatic</h3>
        <p>Okay, the development that I'm making in my head and in my personal notebook is cool and all, but where are we going concretely?</p>
        <p>I had to make a first animatic for the entire film. I was really intimidated to start, but I found a process that worked for me and I just went for it.</p>
        <p>Fighting is fast, restless, and so had to be my animating. I didn't want to spend too much time lingering on perfect blocking and tiny little details in this first pass of animatic: I had to go for movement, for intuition, for flow.</p>
        <p>I did not fully storyboard the film, but rather wrote down the main beats and animated by using references and moves I had gathered during my research phase.</p>
        <p>. ݁₊ ⊹ . ݁ ⟡ ݁ . ⊹ ₊ ݁.. ݁₊ ⊹ . ݁ ⟡ ݁ . ⊹ ₊ ݁.. ݁₊ ⊹ . ݁ ⟡ ݁ . ⊹ ₊ ݁.</p>
        <h3>// Design exchange</h3>
        <p>Last week, we got to swap our material with another artist in class and give feedback and suggestions. It was a very refreshing exercise and I got some really interesting notes. My exchange parter suggested that I develop the lore a bit further on screen to amplify the viewer's understanding of and engagement to the fight, for example by showing examples of the clone harassing Mars in the pre-fight world. I also got suggestions regarding the blocking and framing, mostly regarding the camera moves and angles (make them crazier) and the character's reactions (make em more dramatic).</p>
        <p>. ݁₊ ⊹ . ݁ ⟡ ݁ . ⊹ ₊ ݁.. ݁₊ ⊹ . ݁ ⟡ ݁ . ⊹ ₊ ݁.. ݁₊ ⊹ . ݁ ⟡ ݁ . ⊹ ₊ ݁.</p>
        <p>// Sound: Finally, I started working on some very rough scratch sound for my animatic. One thing that I love doing for my projects is to create playlists, and so I gathered songs that reminded me of my film or that are close to what I would like to use as the soundtrack for it. It's a mix of recent metal music, techno, game music and EDM, anything that gives me that intense cyberpunk face-off feel. For the actual animatic, I temporarily used a track from the video game Cyberpunk 2077, which I don't think is 100% fitting but it is a great placeholder.</p>
        <p>I also got to attend a irl foley session/demonstration last week as part of a class I'm assisting with, which got me thinking about my own sound recording session that will take place next semester. I really want to record my own foley in the studio, I think it will be really dope with all the crazy action and punching and slamming happening in the film. </p>
        <h3>// Additional inspo/media/news</h3>
        <p>I watched the movie The Substance last week, which actually reminded me of my film in some ways with the whole clone situation and the themes of self-hatred, sci-fi, fear of oneself, and "being one". A very inspiring viewing!</p>
        <img src="images/substance.webp" alt="">

        <p>I've also seen the trailer for the new movie Mickey 17, which is also about clones! So many clone movies! I just think it's a fun coincidence hihi</p>

        <p>Take care everyone! ⟡ ݁ . ⊹</p>

        <p>Today I presented the first rough version of my animatic in class, which I was actually pretty excited about. I worked hard last week to complete this first version (though unfortunately I can't share it here because it uses temporary copyrighted music:')))</p>
        <p>. ݁₊ ⊹ . ݁ ⟡ ݁ . ⊹ ₊ ݁.. ݁₊ ⊹ . ݁ ⟡ ݁ . ⊹ ₊ ݁.. ݁₊ ⊹ . ݁ ⟡ ݁ . ⊹ ₊ ݁.</p>
        <p>I got some interesting feedback, which I will list here:</p>
        <p>⟡ The fight choreography is quite well established, but it would be interesting to vary shots and camera angles to make it more dynamic</p>
        <p>⟡Similarly, I should ajust some of the framing to make sure that the character's bodies are not cut randomly or just slightly out of the frame</p>
        <p>⟡The sound seems to be working well; I should start thinking about possible music tracks and acquire copyright if necessary. My main plan right now would be to collaborate with a music composer, but since we are only going to meet our possible collaborators in January, I need to prepare secondary options in case something doesn't work then.</p>
        <p>⟡I would be interesting to play with framerate when animating the clone to make her appear more laggy/synthetic, similarly to the technique that was used to animate Hobie Brown in Across the Spiderverse.</p>
        <p>I will definitely keep these elements in mind for the refining of my animatic in the next two weeks:)</p>

        <p>The past two weeks have been pretty hectic, and, unfortunately, I didn't get to work much on this project. However, I got to share it with the class a second time to get some new and fresh feedback before I dive back into it. Here is what I've collected:)</p>
        <p>⟡ The framing could be reworked in some places. Make sure the character's aren't cut off at random places, like the top of the head. Keep the safe zone in mind!</p>
        <p>⟡ Keep searching for music! The placeholder isn't bad, but it's a bit repetitive and gets tiring after a while. Think of something that would have more escalation throuhought the fight. Maybe start it a little later?</p>
        <p>⟡ Add more fighting noises/grunts/screams/etc! Fill the space! Similarly, I should start thinking of the ambient sound to construct the space of the fight. What does the void sound like? What do we hear beyond it? What is happening off-screen?</p>

        <p>I will soon start making my production schedule for the rest of this project. We're almost half-way through the year and almost done with pre-prod! This is insane!</p>
        <p>A little personal update, I watched a fantastic movie called Red Rooms (Les chambres rouges in French) this weekend and I can't stop thinking about it! It really shook me to my core, it was so creepy and liminal with its use of technology and screens and the dark web...it gave me a really chilling feeling that I couldn't shake off for a while. Actually, the feeling it gave me reminded me of another horror film I adore, We're All Going to the World's Fair. I need to revisit it as well...perhaps those elements and feelings can inspire me for the construction and feel of the digital environment in my own film? I really have a fascination with technology and the digital realm, this is exciting to me. I'll see where the inspiration gets me! ⊹</p>

        <p>// I spent a few hours in the lab yesterday and I created a five second 3D mockup of one of the shots in my film. My goal was, since I'm not able to film myself doing what the characters do in the film, to use 3D character models and have them act as my reference, with the camera movements included. I don't have a lot of experience in 3D but I do really enjoy it and thought that this would make my life easier when it's time to do the 2D animation, as I could use the 3D mockup like a video reference for the characters' poses and the complex camera angles. I have to say, I'm really happy with the result! Although the timing is not perfect, that's something I can adjust in TVPaint later, and at least all of the basic poses and camera angles are there for me to either rotoscope or reference indirectly:)</p>
        <div class="photo-grid">
            <img src="images/3d1.jpg" alt="">

            <img src="images/3d3.jpg" alt="">
        </div>

        <p>some screencaps of the reference I made in Maya!</p>

        <p>Since for the rest of the semester, I must be working on a 5-seconds proof of concept for my film, I thought that I would use that shot, having already spent quite some time planning it and making the reference for it (coincidentally, it is exactly 5 seconds long!)</p>
        <p>I'm finding myself wishing that I could do my entire film in 3D, but I know that it would not be wise as I just started learning 3D and don't even know how to rig a character yet, let alone properly animate it (I used a premade model for my mockup haha). However, I'm thinking of ways in which I could still inorporate some 3D elements to my film. An idea that I've been toying around with in my mind would be to make a 3D background on top of which I would animate the characters. A friend also suggested that I make the end credits in 3D, which I think could be really interesting!</p>
        <p>// On a different note, I started thinking more seriously about the final look of the film, and I made this mockup screencap to explore color and lighting:</p>
        <img src="images/concept.jpg" alt="">
        <p>I do wish the lines were a bit cleaner and sharper, but overall I'm quite happy with the color and general vibes. I'm going to explore ways in TVPaint or After Effect to render the lighting effect more efficiently (for now I only added it by hand, which would be very time consuming if I did it over the entire film).</p>
        <p>// So what am I doing next?</p>
        <p>⟡ Make a turnaround reference for Mars so it's easier to draw her consistently in the long run</p>
        <p>⟡ Finish tweaking and reframing the shots in the animatic (it's been dragging on for too long at this point haha)</p>
        <p>⟡Start working on the 5 seconds test; import the reference, tweak the timing, do the rough animation, cleanup, color, composite (a lot of work still!)</p>
        <p>⟡ As always, continue thinking of sound and music, although the visual aspect is more of a priority in the short term.</p>

        <p>LOOK AT THAT! ⟡ I am so happy that I can finally get a concrete look at what my final film is going to look like, this is super exciting to me:'))</p>
        <p>The last week was intense! I spent multiple hours working on animation, color choices, coloring, watching after effects tutorials on youtube, testing things, and compositing. But the final result really renewed my motivation towards this project and I cannot wait to work on it further :))</p>
        <p>The thing I am most worried about currently is time; this 5-second shot took me over 15 hours to complete, and I now have to make a whole two minutes :0</p>
        <p>But I have to remember that this one took longer because it was the first: I had to figure out my workflow and visual style and there was a lot of trial and error. I lost a lot of time with my keyframes because I didn't quite plan them properly, and then I had to redo most of them, which took an extra 2 hours. Besides, I watched a lot of video tutorials to help me with the compositing and rendering, which was time consuming as well. </p>
        <p>The key will be organisation. I started preparing my schedule for the next semester and will update it here as soon as the first draft is done. The timeframe is going to be tight. At least we have some time to start over the break, so although I really need a break right now, I will be back soon enough in the lab to animate :'))</p>

        <p>In other news, we did an editing exchange last week and my friend Grace did some lovely sound work for my film! It gave me some really nice ideas, such as starting the beat of the music during the intro dialog and going for a more video gamey vibe in the music. </p>
        <p>Speaking of, I am still undecided about the music. There's this song that I love and I wish I could get the rights for it, so I'm planning on contacting the artists with my 5 second proof of concept to see if they'd let me use the song (not revealing the song, I don't wanna jinx it;))</p>
        <p>That's just an option, otherwise I'll search into free music archive (where Grace actually found her music suggestion for my film) and wait for the collaboration as well to see if anyone would like to compose something specifically for my film.</p>
        <p>Speaking of music, here is my updated inspiration playlist, on YouTube this time so it's more accessible to anyone who wants to give it a listen:)</p>

        <img src="images/jinx.jpg" alt="">
        <p>This show is just phenomenal and the fact that it came out at this specific moment is perfect; it's reigniting my love for animation and makes me so inspired to continue my own project. Everything about the artistic direction, the designs, the shots, the music, the sound, ah! I just love it so much!! And I'm super hyped for what comes next!</p>

        <p>We are done with the first half of the year already! This feels unreal, and a bit intimidating... there is still so much work to do!</p>
        <p>For now I will take a break from the lab for the rest of 2025; that doesn't mean I won't be touching this project at all! Here are the little things I plan on finalizing for the rest of the year:</p>
        <p>⟡ Refine my production schedule for January-April</p>
        <p>⟡ Contact the artists I would like to possibly use a song from</p>
        <p>⟡ Experiment with different visuals for the opening and end credits</p>
        <p>⟡ If possible, prepare/collect video references for the final animation (ideally I'd like to produce a few more 3D refs to make some of the action smoother to animate in 2D)</p>
        <p>And that's it for now!</p>
        <p>I'll also add here some of the advice I received during our last class and that I will apply once I get back to animating:</p>
        <p>⟡ Add something in the background; a simple grid, some effects like flashing or cascading code/glitches, perhaps a gradient / some lighter and darker blue, etc.</p>
        <p>⟡ Make the "O" of A-OKAY easier to read in the opening title</p>
        <p>⟡ Think about how the damage taken from the fight will be represented; are there bruises? Blood? Virtual damage? Glitches? A mix of a few things?</p>

        <p>Now that's really it for now! I will be back in 2025 and I am super excited to start production! I can't believe we're this far already and I am really happy of the work accomplished so far.</p>
        <p>Happy new year and see you soon:]</p>

        <p>It's been a while! I've been back to production for almost 3 weeks now and I almost forgot I had to update haha</p>
        <p>But to be fair, nothing too crazy has happened; I mostly just got back to the lab and I've been animating nonstop!:0</p>
        <p>We do have some good news though;) </p>
        <p>⟡ I found a voice actress for Mars and the clone; one of my friends is coming to the recording studio this week and she's going to record her lines! I am so happy that she accepted to do this for me and I think her voice is perfect for this dual role:)</p>
        <p>⟡ I have found a music composer as well! We haven't met yet but we exchanged a few emails and we're both very excited to work on this project together in the near future! I can't wait to see what he makes, I was amazed by his portfolio and I think he's a perfect fit for the vibe I'm going for in my film.</p>
        <p>I will update soon with some color thumbnails and stills from the work in progress animation! I gotta go back to work, but everything's going A-OKAY for now;) (see what I did here...)</p>

        <p>To end this quick update, I have to say that I've been playing a lot of Cyberpunk 2077 over the holiday and it has really reignited my love for the genre! It gave me some cool ideas for both visuals and lore, which I'm excited to be working on!</p>

        <p>some lighting tests - not sure about those! i'm going to try and draw some color thumbnails to plan out more efficiently how I want the lighting to look and what story it can tell.</p>

        <p>Just a quick update for today:') I've been sick for the past few days and production has been on hold because of that. </p>
        <p>That being said, I finally had my voice recording session on Thursday! We ran into a few technical issues but once we were all set up my lovely friend/voice actress did an AMAZING job delivering the voicelines of my characters. We also did a few grunts and panting passes for the action. Photos of the recording coming soon:)</p>
        <p>I haven't been able to edit the footage yet due to my sickness but I should be able to do that very soon. There's only a few days before picture lock! We stay strong⟡</p>

        <h3>⟡ animation</h3>
        <p>My rough animation is 100% completed and the clean animation is around 90%. There's only a few shots left, one of which is primarily rotoscoped so it should be finished by the end of this week.</p>
        <h3>⟡ color/rendering</h3>
        <p>I am so excited to start the coloring and rendering in After Effects! I have been looking forward to that phase since I made my proof-of-concept all the way back in November. It's really what makes the whole film come together for me! I've been working on some color thumbnails inspired by what I've seen artists do for Disney movies, I will share it here when it's more advanced</p>
        <h3>⟡  credits</h3>
        <p>I got the permission to work on the end credits for A-OKAY in a different class, which I'm excited to get into. I already shared the thumbnails here and will make a rough first pass some time this week.</p>
        <h3>⟡ music</h3>
        <p>I met with the composer I'm working with about a week ago and I was amazed at what he did! The music fits perfectly with my film. There were some small details to tweak and he sent me the latest version this weekend, so now it's really really close to being done! I couldn't be happier about the work he has done:D</p>
        <h3>⟡ challenges/difficulties</h3>
        <p>Production has been going quite smoothly since the reading break, which is partly why I didn't post here as much as I would have wanted. My biggest challenge right now is managing all the different deadlines from my different classes. I wish I could focus 100% on A-OKAY for the final stretch, but that's not possible, so I'll have to be very organized!</p>
